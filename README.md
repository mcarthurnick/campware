# CampWare - Campground CMS

There are a few things that CampWare will be able to do as an MVP:

    1. Users can:
        Register with CampWare
        Login / Logout with Authentication
        Search for a campsite within a campground
        Add information to their profile

    2. Campground Owners can:
        Register as an Admin
        Update campground information
        Add a campsite within the campground
        Delete a campsite or campground
    
    3. List available Campgrounds & Campsites
    4. Filter & Sort results



    For this project I will be using:
        FrontEnd: Vite, React, Redux and React-Boostrap
        BackEnd: Express, Sequelize and Postgres
